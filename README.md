1. Here we provided four spike encoding models including bioinspired auditory neuron (BAN), izhikevich (Izh), leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF), and poisson in Encoding_model folder.  
2. TIDIGITS, RWCP and NOISEX-92 datasets in snndatabase folder.  
3. We provided encoded data with BAN spike encoding models in TIDIGITS, RWCP datasets,respectively. (Timesteps=10) in After_encoding_data folder.  
4. We provided training model and evaluation results at timesteps of 10 with BAN spike encoding modelata with BAN spike encoding models in snnmodel folder.  
5. We provided training and testing code for SNN.
